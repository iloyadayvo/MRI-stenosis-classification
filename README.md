## Weighted Random Forest for MRI Classification of Spinal Canal Stenosis
## Project Description: This project focuses on developing and implementing a machine learning model to classify MRI images of the spinal canal into three categories: Moderate, Normal, and Severe. Using a weighted Random Forest classifier, the model aims to accurately diagnose the severity of spinal canal stenosis based on MRI data.
